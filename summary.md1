__Title__: Data-Driven Passivity Based Control of Robotic Locomotion and Manipulation

__Abstract__:
The recent boom and success of machine learning methods has encouraged efforts
in synthesizing controllers that leverage neural networks as function
approximators. However, when such controllers are synthesized it is important to
take precautions against their potential vulnerabilities against disturbances
arising from model uncertainties or measurement noise. In this work we address
the automatic robust data-driven controller synthesis problem for robotic
manipulation and locomotion. We demonstrate the efficacy of our theoretical
results in simulation and real-world experiments on a rimless-wheel and a
cart-pole system that contains walls. Our approach performs repeated
interactions with a nominal dynamical model to infer a contact-aware
passivity-based controller, whose storage function is given by a fully-connected
neural network. Contacts, impacts and Coulomb friction are modeled through the
linear complementarity problem (LCP), and solved via Lemkeâ€™s algorithm, which
allows us to take pertinent gradients for the data-driven technique.
Additionally, we improve the robustness properties of the controller under model
uncertainties, such as the rimless wheel traversing on uneven terrain, via
Bayesian learning.
