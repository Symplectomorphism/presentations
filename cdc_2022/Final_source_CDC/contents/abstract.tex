Inspired by passivity-based control (PBC) techniques, we propose a data-driven
approach in order to learn a neural net parameterized storage function of
underactuated mechanical systems.
%
First, the PBC problem is cast as an optimization problem that searches for
point estimates of the neural net parameters.
%
Then, we improve the robustness properties of this deterministic framework
against system parameter uncertainties and measurement error by injecting
techniques from Bayesian inference. 
%
In the Bayesian framework, the neural net parameters are samples drawn from a
posterior distribution learned via Variational Inference. 
%
We demonstrate the performance of the deterministic and Bayesian
trainings on the swing-up task of an inertia wheel pendulum in simulation and
real-world experiments.
