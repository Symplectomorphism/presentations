  abstract = {Estimating the traversability of rough terrain is a critical task for an outdoor mobile robot. While classifying structured environment can be learned from large number of training data, it is an extremely difficult task to learn and estimate traversability of unstructured rough terrain. Moreover, in many cases information from a single sensor may not be sufficient for estimating traversability reliably in the absence of artificial landmarks such as lane markings or curbs. Our approach estimates traversability of the terrain and build a 2D probabilistic grid map online using 3D-LIDAR and camera. The combination of LIDAR and camera is favoured in many robotic application because they provide complementary information. Our approach assumes the data captured by these two sensors are independent and build separate traversability maps, each with information captured from one sensor. Traversability estimation with vision sensor autonomously collects training data and update classifier without human intervention as the vehicle traverse the terrain. Traversability estimation with 3D-LIDAR measures the slopes of the ground to predict the traversability. Two independently built probabilistic maps are fused using Bayes' rule to improve the detection performance. This is in contrast with other methods in which each sensor performs different tasks. We have implemented the algorithm on a UGV(Unmanned Ground Vehicle) and tested our approach on a rough terrain to evaluate the detection performance.},

Trends Robotics},abstract={Factor Graphs for Robot Perception reviews the use of factor graphs for the modeling and solving of large-scale inference problems in robotics. Factor graphs are a family of probabilistic graphical models, other examples of which are Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, well known from the statistical modeling and machine learning literature. They provide a powerful abstraction that gives insight into particular inference problems, making it easier to think about and design solutions, and write modular software to perform the actual inference. This book illustrates their use in the simultaneous localization and mapping problem and other important problems associated with deploying robots in the real world. Factor graphs are introduced as an economical representation within which to formulate the different inference problems, setting the stage for the subsequent sections on practical methods to solve them. The book explains the nonlinear optimization techniques for solving arbitrary nonlinear factor graphs, which requires repeatedly solving large sparse linear systems. Factor Graphs for Robot Perception will be of interest to students, researchers and practicing roboticists with an interest in the broad impact factor graphs have had, and continue to have, in robot perception.}}

The semantic SLAM problem can be decomposed into a discrete inference problem: determining object class labels and measurement-landmark correspondences (the data association problem), and a continuous inference problem: obtaining the set of robot poses and object locations in the environment. A solution to the semantic SLAM problem necessarily addresses this joint inference, but under ambiguous data associations this is in general a non-Gaussian inference problem, while the majority of previous work focuses on Gaussian inference. Previous solutions to data association either produce solutions between potential hypotheses or maintain multiple explicit hypotheses for each association. We propose a solution that represents hypotheses as multiple modes of an equivalent non-Gaussian sensor model. We then solve the resulting non-Gaussian inference problem using nonparametric belief propagation. We validate our approach in a simulated hallway environment under a variety of sensor noise characteristics, as well as using real data from the KITTI dataset, demonstrating improved robustness to perceptual aliasing and odometry uncertainty.}}

NF-iSAM exploits the expressive power of neural networks, and trains normalizing flows to draw samples from the joint posterior of non-Gaussian factor graphs. By leveraging the Bayes tree, NF-iSAM is able to exploit the sparsity structure of SLAM, thus enabling efficient incremental updates similar to iSAM2, albeit in the more challenging non-Gaussian setting. We demonstrate the performance of NF-iSAM and compare it against the state-of-the-art algorithms such as iSAM2 (Gaussian) and mm-iSAM (non-Gaussian) in synthetic and real range-only SLAM datasets.}}

Perceptual aliasing is a phenomenon where different places generate a similar visual (or, in general, perceptual) footprint. This causes spurious measurements to be fed to the SLAM estimator, which typically results in incorrect localization and mapping results. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that those outliers are  highly correlated , in the sense that perceptual aliasing creates a large number of mutually consistent outliers. Another issue stems from the fact that most state-of-the-art techniques rely on a  given trajectory guess  (e.g., from odometry) to discern between inliers and outliers, and this makes the resulting pipeline brittle, since the accumulation of error may result in incorrect choices and recovery from failures is far from trivial. This paper provides a unified framework to  model  perceptual aliasing in SLAM and provides practical algorithms that can cope with outliers without relying on any initial guess. We present two main contributions. The first is a  discrete–continuous graphical model  ( DC-GM ) for SLAM: The continuous portion of the  DC-GM  captures the standard SLAM problem, while the discrete portion describes the selection of the outliers and models their correlation. The second contribution is a semidefinite relaxation to perform inference in the  DC-GM  that returns estimates with provable sub-optimality guarantees. Experimental results on standard benchmarking datasets show that the proposed technique compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods while not relying on an initial guess for optimization.}}

ABSTRACT = {At present, the method of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with traditional navigation equipment for inspection of overhead transmission lines has the limitations of expensive sensors, difficult data processing, and vulnerable to weather and environmental factors, which cannot ensure the safety of UAV and power systems. Therefore, this paper establishes a mathematical model of spatial distribution of transmission lines to study the field strength distribution information around transmission lines. Based on this, research the navigation and positioning algorithm. The data collected by the positioning system are input into the mathematical model to complete the identification, positioning, and safety distance diagnosis of the field source. The detected data and processing results can provide reference for UAV obstacle avoidance navigation and safety warning. The experimental results show that the positioning effect of the positioning navigation algorithm is obvious, and the positioning error is within the range of use error and has good usability and application value.},

In this paper, a new hierarchical infrared navigational algorithm hybridization (HIRNAH) system is developed to provide better state estimation and localization for mobile robots. Two navigation subsystems (inertial navigation system (INS) and, using a novel infrared navigation algorithm (NIRNA), Odom-NIRNA) and an RPLIDAR-A3 scanner cooperation to build HIRNAH. The robot pose (position and orientation) errors are estimated by a system filtering module (SFM) and used to smooth the robot’s final poses. A prototype (two rotary encoders, one smartphone-based robot sensing model and one RPLIDAR-A3 scanner) has been built and mounted on a four-wheeled mobile robot (4-WMR). Simulation results have motivated real-life experiments, and obtained results are compared to some existent research (hardware and control technology navigation (HCTNav), rapid exploring random tree (RRT) and in stand-alone mode (INS)) for performance measurements. The experimental results confirm that HIRNAH presents a more accurate estimation and a lower mean square error (MSE) of the robot’s state than those calculated by the previously cited HCTNav, RRT and INS.}}

  abstract = {A cycloidal rotor is an innovative horizontal axis propulsion system, which is utilized in the present study to develop a fully-controllable flying aircraft (known as “Cyclogyro”). The present 535 gram cyclogyro uses a hybrid configuration with two cyclorotors and a horizontal tail rotor. Since a cycloidal rotor relies on cyclic blade pitching for producing thrust and also for control, designing a reliable pitch mechanism that can provide the required blade pitching kinematics (depending on the advance ratio) is extremely important. A novel blade pitch mechanism has been developed, which is passively driven by centrifugal force, and could potentially be adapted to generate the required pitching schedules for efficient operation over a range of advance ratios. A simplified flightworthy version of this mechanism was implemented in the present cyclogyro. The mechanism was able to generate the appropriate blade kinematics and the thrust required for the vehicle to hover. Also, the present mechanism is designed such that it is possible to vary both amplitude and phasing of the cyclic blade pitching. A novel control strategy was developed using blade pitch amplitude (thrust magnitude) control for roll, phasing (thrust direction) for yaw and tail rotor for pitch control. The control strategy was implemented using a three gram onboard processor, which was used to stabilize the vehicle without a pilot, through a closed-loop feedback control system. This is the first flight-capable cyclogyro reported in the literature to utilize cycloidal rotors having both pitch amplitude and phase control. The successful flight for the present vehicle also validates the flightworthiness of this completely passive pitch mechanism design, which has great potential for efficient forward flight.},

ABSTRACT={In this paper, we present a modular and flexible state estimation framework for legged robots operating in real-world scenarios, where environmental conditions, such as occlusions, low light, rough terrain, and dynamic obstacles can severely impair estimation performance. At the core of the proposed estimation system, called Pronto, is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that fuses IMU and Leg Odometry sensing for pose and velocity estimation. We also show how Pronto can integrate pose corrections from visual and LIDAR and odometry to correct pose drift in a loosely coupled manner. This allows it to have a real-time proprioceptive estimation thread running at high frequency (250–1,000 Hz) for use in the control loop while taking advantage of occasional (and often delayed) low frequency (1–15 Hz) updates from exteroceptive sources, such as cameras and LIDARs. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the approach, we have tested it on a variety of legged platforms, including two humanoid robots (the Boston Dynamics Atlas and NASA Valkyrie) and two dynamic quadruped robots (IIT HyQ and ANYbotics ANYmal) for more than 2 h of total runtime and 1.37 km of distance traveled. The tests were conducted in a number of different field scenarios under the conditions described above. The algorithms presented in this paper are made available to the research community as open-source ROS packages.}

Furthermore, the descriptor similarity can be evaluated using the Hamming distance, which is very efficient to compute, instead of the L2 norm as is usually done.",

ABSTRACT = {China completed the construction of more than 1.15 million kilometers of transmission lines with conventional voltage levels spanning its vast territory in 2014. This large and complicated power grid structure relies mainly on manual operation and maintenance of lines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-definition digital video cameras and cameras and GPS positioning systems can conduct autonomous patrols along the grid. However, the presence of electromagnetic fields around high-voltage transmission lines can affect the UAV’s magnetometer, resulting in a wrong heading and thus unsafe flight. In this paper, the traditional method of UAV heading calculation using a magnetometer was analyzed, and a novel method for calculating UAV heading based on dual antennas was proposed. Experimental data showed that the proposed method improves the anti-magnetic interference characteristics of UAVs and increases UAV security and stability for power inspection applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Noise appears in images captured by real cameras. This paper studies the influence of noise on monocular feature-based visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). First, an open-source synthetic dataset with different noise levels is introduced in this paper. Then the images in the dataset are denoised using the Fast and Flexible Denoising convolutional neural Network (FFDNet); the matching performances of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) which are commonly used in feature-based SLAM are analyzed in comparison and the results show that ORB has a higher correct matching rate than that of SIFT and SURF, the denoised images have a higher correct matching rate than noisy images. Next, the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) of noisy and denoised sequences are evaluated on ORB-SLAM2 and the results show that the denoised sequences perform better than the noisy sequences at any noise level. Finally, the completely clean sequence in the dataset and the sequences in the KITTI dataset are denoised and compared with the original sequence through comprehensive experiments. For the clean sequence, the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of ATE after denoising has decreased by 16.75%; for KITTI sequences, 7 out of 10 sequences have lower RMSE than the original sequences. The results show that the denoised image can achieve higher accuracy in the monocular feature-based visual SLAM under certain conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensed data are often adversely affected by many types of noise, which influences the classification result. Supervised machine-learning (ML) classifiers such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) are broadly reported to improve robustness against noise. However, only a few comparative studies that may help investigate this robustness have been reported. An important contribution, going beyond previous studies, is that we perform the analyses by employing the most well-known and broadly implemented packages of the three classifiers and control their settings to represent users&rsquo; actual applications. This facilitates an understanding of the extent to which the noise types and levels in remotely sensed data impact classification accuracy using ML classifiers. By using those implementations, we classified the land cover data from a satellite image that was separately afflicted by seven-level zero-mean Gaussian, salt&ndash;pepper, and speckle noise. The modeling data and features were strictly controlled. Finally, we discussed how each noise type affects the accuracy obtained from each classifier and the robustness of the classifiers to noise in the data. This may enhance our understanding of the relationship between noises, the supervised ML classifiers, and remotely sensed data.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive survey of robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), a technique that develops policies from example state to action mappings. We introduce the LfD design choices in terms of demonstrator, problem space, policy derivation and performance, and contribute the foundations for a structure in which to categorize LfD research. Specifically, we analyze and categorize the multiple ways in which examples are gathered, ranging from teleoperation to imitation, as well as the various techniques for policy derivation, including matching functions, dynamics models and plans. To conclude we discuss LfD limitations and related promising areas for future research.}

abstract = {This paper is a brief survey on the existing problems and challenges inherent in model-based control (MBC) theory, and some important issues in the analysis and design of data-driven control (DDC) methods are here reviewed and addressed. The necessity of data-driven control is discussed from the aspects of the history, the present, and the future of control theories and applications. The state of the art of the existing DDC methods and applications are presented with appropriate classifications and insights. The relationship between the MBC method and the DDC method, the differences among different DDC methods, and relevant topics in data-driven optimization and modeling are also highlighted. Finally, the perspective of DDC and associated research topics are briefly explored and discussed.}
